KINGLE hiring task
As a part of the recruitment process, we ask our candidates to complete a practical development
challenge. The challenge consists of two parts:
1. You solve the provided task, and send the results to us.
2. We host a session where you present your solution to us, and we all have a nice talk about it.
The task is to implement a simple time logger web application that solves the following three user
stories:
1. As a freelancer I want to be able to register how I spend time on my projects, so that I can
provide my customers with an overview of my work.
2. As a freelancer I want to be able to get an overview of my time registrations per project, so that I
can create correct invoices for my customers.
3. As a freelancer I want to be able to sort my projects by their deadline, so that I can priorities my
work.
Individual time registrations should be 30 minutes or longer, and once a project is complete it can no
longer receive new registrations. You do not need to create an actual invoice.
Simply send us the project in a zip if you prefer. We recommend removing installed dependencies prior
to zipping, to keep the file size down.
